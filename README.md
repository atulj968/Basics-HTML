# Basics-HTML
HTML(Hyper text markup language) is mainly use to make webpages and web applications.I am going to show some basics in this project.
# Basic HTML Document
Every HTML document begins with a HTML document tag.
    html:Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic "HTML" tags. It begins with html and ends with "/html" tag.
    head : The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or document like the title of the page and other miscellaneous information. These informations are enclosed within "head" tag which opens with head and ends with "/head". The contents will of this tag will be explained in the later sections of course.
     title : We can mention the title of a web page using the "title" tag. This is a header information and hence mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with "title" and ends with "/title".
     body : Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with "body" and ends with "/body". Every content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be it writings or images or audios or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may insert mentioned contents into our web pages.
# HTML Heading
These tags help us to give headings to the content of a webpage. These tags are mainly written inside the HTML provides us with six heading tags from "h1" to "h6". Every tag displays the heading in a different style.
# HTML Paragraph
These tags help us to write paragraph statements in a webpage. They start with the 'p' tag and ends with 'p'. Here the 'br' tag is used to break line and acts as a carriage return. 'br' is an empty tag.
# Comments
If you want to comment on code to show something to developer you can comment by usnig "<!--".
# Spacing
If you want to space between lines you can use 'br' command. And if you want to space between the words you can use '&nbsp' command.
# Horizontal Line
The 'hr' tag is used to break the page into various parts, creating horizontal margins with help of a horizontal line running from left to right hand side of the page. This is also an empty tag and doesnâ€™t take any additional statements.
# Listing
HTML provide listing in two ways:
1.Unordered Listing
2.Ordered Listing
  In unordered  listing  there is no numbering on elements.For unordered listing we use 'ul' tag.
  In ordered listing we can give numbers to the elements.For ordered listing we use 'li' tag.

# Table
The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.
The HTML tables are created using the 'table' tag in which the 'tr' tag is used to create table rows and 'td' tag is used to create data cells. The elements under 'td' are regular.
